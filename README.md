# Ikea-Stock-Emailer
Furniture kept going out of stock at Ikea during the Coronavirus pandemic so I wrote this script to send me automated emails on product availability.

Emails can only be sent <b>from</b> emails using Outlook SMTP settings (@outlook and @hotmail), but can be sent <b>to</b> any email address.

Usage: python
