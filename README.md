# Ikea Stock Emailer
Furniture kept going out of stock at Ikea during the Coronavirus pandemic so I wrote this script to send automated emails on product availability.

Emails can only be sent <b>from</b> emails using Outlook SMTP settings (@outlook and @hotmail), but can be sent <b>to</b> any email address.

# Requirements

<= Python 3.7

Outlook or Hotmail email

# Usage
python ikeastock.py 

# Additional Notes
Ikea item IDs can be found in the url of the item on the ikea website. It will be the digits at the end of the url. Omit any letters or other characters such as slashes.
